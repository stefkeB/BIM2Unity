# BIM2Unity

Unity projects, where I investigate the different methods to get BIM models geometry and information inside a Unity project.

# Licensing

Beware that some projects may contain additional Unity packages or .NET libraries which may have their own license. Unfortunately, you have to investigate in your particular case, if they can be used. I'm thinking about plugins, but also external DLLs and source-code libraries or examples. Especially for geometrical operations, not everything here is written from scratch.
